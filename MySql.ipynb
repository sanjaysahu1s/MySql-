    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of data. It is designed to provide a reliable and consistent way to store and retrieve large amounts of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, querying languages, and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "- SQL databases are based on the relational data model, where data is organized into tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "- They use SQL as the standard language for defining, manipulating, and retrieving data.\n",
    "- SQL databases ensure data consistency and enforce data integrity through the use of primary keys, foreign keys, and relational constraints.\n",
    "- They are best suited for structured and predefined data with complex relationships and heavy transactional workloads.\n",
    "- Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "- NoSQL databases utilize various data models such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph to store and manage data.\n",
    "- They provide flexible schemas and are schema-less, meaning that each record or document can have a different structure.\n",
    "- NoSQL databases often use different query languages specific to their data model, rather than SQL.\n",
    "- They are highly scalable and can handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "- NoSQL databases are commonly used for handling high-velocity data, real-time analytics, and distributed systems.\n",
    "- Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase, and Neo4j.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on various factors such as the nature of the data, scalability requirements, performance needs, and the specific use case of the application."

    "1. Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique, ensuring that no two rows in the table have the same primary key value.\n",
    "2. Non-nullability: A primary key column cannot have a null value, meaning it must always have a valid value assigned.\n",

    "1. Referential Integrity: A foreign key ensures that the values in the column(s) referencing the primary key of another table correspond to existing values in that primary key column.\n",
